# Spec: Scales page

> First feature. Status: v1.0 (brainstorming complete, 2026-05-12). Owner: Aurélien.

## Goal

A page where a user picks a root note and immediately sees every relevant jazz scale built on it, with notation, audio playback, and the ability to save selected scales to a personal collection and print them.

## Why

Jazz students and players constantly look up "what scales work over X." Existing tools are either dense reference tables or paywalled. A clean, fast, mobile-friendly tool is genuinely useful, and the domain (music theory) is small and well-defined, which makes it a good learning vehicle.

## User stories

1. **Pick a root.** As a user, I select a root note (12 chromatic options, with enharmonic awareness — e.g., F♯ vs G♭).
2. **See all scales.** I see every scale rooted on that note, grouped by family (modes of major, melodic minor, harmonic minor, symmetric, pentatonic/blues, bebop, exotic).
3. **See it on score and keyboard.** Each scale shows standard notation (one octave ascending, treble clef) *and* a piano keyboard with the scale notes highlighted.
4. **Hear it.** I can click a scale to hear it played.
5. **Save it.** I can star/save a scale to "My Collection" (localStorage).
6. **View my collection.** A separate view lists my saved scales with notation and playback.
7. **Print a sheet.** I can select multiple scales from my collection and print them onto a single, well-laid-out sheet (A4 and US Letter).

## Functional requirements

### Root picker

- Chromatic picker, 12 buttons, each pre-spelled with its jazz-default enharmonic
- Default selection: C
- **Layout — single component, two CSS layouts:**
  - Mobile (< 768 px): **4 columns × 3 rows** grid, chromatic order across (C, D♭, D, E♭ / E, F, F♯, G / A♭, A, B♭, B)
  - Tablet / desktop (≥ 768 px): horizontal row of 12 buttons
  - Implementation: one React component, `grid-template-columns` swapped at the `md:` breakpoint. Identical button behavior across both layouts.
- **Selected root** is visually highlighted (accent background + focus ring) and exposed via `aria-pressed` for screen readers

**Default spellings** (flat-side wins for all ambiguous pitches except F♯, which is a true wash and follows sharp-side tradition):

| Position | Default label | Toggle alternate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | C | — |
| 2 | D♭ | C♯ |
| 3 | D | — |
| 4 | E♭ | D♯ |
| 5 | E | — |
| 6 | F | — |
| 7 | F♯ | G♭ |
| 8 | G | — |
| 9 | A♭ | G♯ |
| 10 | A | — |
| 11 | B♭ | A♯ |
| 12 | B | — |

**Enharmonic toggle (per-button, not global).** On the five ambiguous buttons (D♭, E♭, F♯, A♭, B♭), a small corner sub-button shows the alternate spelling (♯ or ♭). Tapping the body of the button **selects** that root; tapping the corner sub-button **flips** the spelling in place (D♭ ↔ C♯, etc.) without moving cells. The seven natural buttons (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) have no toggle — visual cue that they are unambiguous. Toggling re-spells **only that button**; the other 11 stay on their defaults. The URL reflects the current spelling.

The corner sub-button is visually small (~14 px) but has invisible padding extending the hit area to ≥ 24 px square per WCAG 2.5.5. Separate `aria-label` from the main button (e.g. `"Switch D-flat to C-sharp"`).

**No auto-flip policy.** The scale list always uses the exact root spelling the user selected, across every scale and mode. If the user picks D♭, every row shows `D♭ Ionian`, `D♭ Dorian`, …, `D♭ Locrian` — even when the resulting spelling is gnarly (e.g. `D♭ Aeolian` produces `D♭ E♭ F♭ G♭ A♭ B𝄫 C♭`). The user can toggle to C♯ to get the clean spelling. Predictability and consistency are the priority; Tonal handles the underlying note math.

**URL format:**

- Natural notes: `/scales/C`, `/scales/D`, `/scales/E`, `/scales/F`, `/scales/G`, `/scales/A`, `/scales/B`
- Flats (defaults for ambiguous pitches): `/scales/D-flat`, `/scales/E-flat`, `/scales/A-flat`, `/scales/B-flat`
- Sharps (defaults + alternates): `/scales/F-sharp` (default), `/scales/C-sharp`, `/scales/D-sharp`, `/scales/G-sharp`, `/scales/A-sharp`, `/scales/G-flat`

**Invalid root paths** (e.g. `/scales/H`, `/scales/c-flat`, `/scales/foo`) redirect to `/scales/C`. The URL is treated as user-provided input — never crashes on unknown roots, never throws.

### Scale list

- Source of truth: Tonal's scale dictionary, supplemented with manually-defined scales where Tonal doesn't expose them under the intended name
- Grouped by family with collapsible sections
- Each scale row shows: **primary name**, optional **alias** (smaller subtitle, only set where a different common name is widely used), **intervals** (e.g. `1 2 ♭3 4 5 6 ♭7`), and **note names** for the currently selected root
- Initial collapsed state: **Modes of major** expanded, all other families collapsed

> Implementation note: when writing `lib/music.ts`, map each row to either a Tonal scale name (`ScaleType.get(...)`) or, when Tonal doesn't expose the intended scale under a usable name, define it from explicit intervals. Cross-checking against `ScaleType.all()` is a TDD task at implementation time, not a spec decision.

### Score (notation) rendering
- abcjs, one octave ascending, treble clef
- Note size readable on mobile (min 14px equivalent)
- Renders synchronously — no flash of unrendered notation

### Piano keyboard rendering

**Implementation:** custom SVG component (no library) — small surface, easy to TDD, full styling control. Hand-built with `<rect>` elements.

**Range: always 2 octaves, C-to-C.** Start at the C at or below the scale root, span exactly two octaves up. Keeping the keyboard outline fixed (always starts at a C, always 24 keys total: 14 white + 10 black) makes the visual consistent across all 12 roots.

**Scale notes highlight in both octaves** of the displayed range — the scale pattern visually repeats across the keyboard. This serves two purposes:

1. The pattern intuition ("ah, it loops every octave") is the whole reason to show two octaves.
2. For high roots (e.g. B, B♭), the scale's own octave sits near the top of the display; without highlighting the second instance, the bottom half of the keyboard would be entirely inert. Filling both octaves keeps the visual balanced across all roots.

For a root like B Mixolydian on a C4–C6 keyboard: the scale notes (B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A) appear highlighted at every occurrence — both at B4 → A5 and at B5 → A6 (and B4/B5 as roots; C♯5/C♯6 as scale tones; etc.). The root is rendered in solid accent at every occurrence in the displayed range.

**Visual treatment of the keys (v1 baseline — subject to visual validation at implementation):**

| Key role | Light theme | Dark theme |
|---|---|---|
| **Root** | solid accent (e.g. `amber-500`) | solid accent (e.g. `amber-400`) |
| **Other scale notes** | light accent (e.g. `amber-200` on white keys; darker amber on black keys) | muted accent |
| **Non-scale notes** | neutral (white keys `stone-50`, black keys `stone-800`) | neutral (inverted) |

A color hierarchy was chosen over the small-marker alternative because color reads at a glance on mobile and there is no slim-black-key marker positioning to manage. **This may be revisited once the component is rendered** — if the chosen accent doesn't actually distinguish the root clearly enough, fall back to a marker (or add one on top of the color).

**Optional toggle:** "Show note names" — when on, displays the note name on each highlighted (scale) key. Off by default to keep the visual clean.

**Interactivity:**

- **v1: static.** No tap-to-play. The "Play scale" button on each scale row (audio engine, Q2 above) covers the main use case. White-key width of ~24 px on mobile is below the 48 px WCAG tap target, which is fine for v1 since the keys aren't interactive.
- **v2 (deferred):** tap-to-play on individual keys. Will need a mobile layout adjustment (e.g. 1-octave-on-mobile or pinch-zoom) to satisfy tap target sizes. Not a v1 problem.

**Synchronous rendering.** No flash of unrendered keyboard. The component takes a small, pure prop shape:

```tsx
type Props = {
  scaleNotes: string[]   // e.g. ['B♭', 'C', 'D♭', 'E♭', 'F', 'G', 'A♭']
  root: string           // e.g. 'B♭'
  startOctave: number    // computed by caller: octave of the "C at or below root"
  showNoteNames?: boolean
}
```

Per CLAUDE.md, domain logic stays in `lib/music.ts` — the component takes pre-computed scale notes and renders. Snapshot tests on the SVG output cover the rendering contract.

### Audio playback

**Engine:** Tone.js `Sampler` with Salamander Grand Piano samples (self-hosted in `/public/audio/piano/`, CC-licensed). Tone.js synth (`PolySynth` with triangle wave + envelope) as a load-failure fallback only.

**Sample set:** ~10 Salamander pitches across the piano range (C2/A2/C3/A3/C4/A4/C5/A5/C6/A6 or equivalent even spread). Served as **OGG with MP3 fallback** (Safari iOS needs MP3). Total payload **~1.2–1.8 MB**, outside the JS budget per the non-functional requirements.

**Playback parameters:** 120 BPM, quarter notes, one octave ascending. One scale plays at a time — clicking another stops the first.

**Lifecycle:**

1. App load: no audio activity. The audio context is not started.
2. First user click on a play button: `Tone.start()` runs inside the click handler (required for iOS Safari autoplay rules), then sample loading begins.
3. While samples load: show an inline indicator on the requested scale row ("loading piano sound…"). Expected: <1s on broadband, 2–4s on 4G.
4. Samples loaded: play the requested scale; subsequent plays are instant. Browser caches the samples for revisits.

**Fallback** (failure mode only, never the default): if sample loading errors out or exceeds **5 seconds**, drop to the synth fallback for the rest of the session and surface a small notice — "piano samples unavailable, using fallback sound".

**Licensing:** Salamander attribution lives next to the audio assets in `public/audio/piano/LICENSE.md` when assets are added.

### Save / collection
- "Star" button on each scale row
- Saved scales: `{ rootNote, scaleName, savedAt }`
- Stored in `localStorage` under key `jazzlore:scales:v1`
- Versioned key so we can migrate cleanly later
- "My Collection" route at `/collection/scales`

**Storage key namespace:** every key written by this app uses the prefix `jazzlore:<feature>:v<n>`. Other keys used in v1: `jazzlore:scales-print:v1` (print density preference), `jazzlore:theme:v1` (theme override). The `lib/storage.ts` wrapper enforces the prefix so no caller can write a bare key. Renames after ship require a migration step in the wrapper.

### Print

**Selection UI** in the collection view: checkboxes on each saved scale + a "Print selected" button.

**Density selector** beside the print button:

```
Layout: ( ) 1 per row    (•) 2 per row    ( ) 3 per row
        bigger notation   default          dense reference
```

Choice persists in `localStorage` under `jazzlore:scales-print:v1`.

| Mode | Per row | Per A4 | Per-scale content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Comfortable | 1 | ~5 | name + alias + intervals + score + note names |
| **Default** | **2** | **~10** | name + intervals + score + note names |
| Dense | 3 | ~15 | name + score only |

**Per-scale block** (default mode):

- Scale name (larger, bold) — with optional alias as smaller subtitle
- Intervals in 40% grey (e.g. `1 2 ♭3 4 5 6 ♭7`)
- abcjs score: one octave ascending, treble clef
- Note names for the current root, below the score

**Page header** on every page: "Jazzlore — My scales" + date (top-left), page number (bottom-right). Small, light grey.

**Print stylesheet rules:**

- `@media print` strips every UI chrome (nav, buttons, toggles, logos)
- `break-inside: avoid` on each scale block (no scale split across pages)
- Backgrounds forced to white (toner-friendly)
- Fluid CSS grid based on viewport width — A4 and US Letter both handled by the same stylesheet, user picks page size in browser print dialog
- abcjs renders SVG, so the music scales cleanly at print DPI; column width drives the music scale factor

**Keyboard is intentionally not included on print.** Printed sheets are for reading and playing — the keyboard is a screen learning aid.

### Theming

Light and dark modes are both supported in v1.

- **Default:** follows the user's system preference via `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Manual override:** a small toggle in the menu (sun/moon icon), persisted in `localStorage` under `jazzlore:theme:v1`. When set, overrides the system preference until cleared.
- **Coverage:** every view renders cleanly in both themes — root picker, scale list, score notation, piano keyboard, audio loading indicators, collection view, modals/toasts.
- **Score notation (abcjs):** inverted in dark mode — light staff lines and noteheads on a dark background. Implementation: abcjs honors CSS overrides; we drive its colors via CSS custom properties that flip on `[data-theme="dark"]`.
- **Print mode:** always light, regardless of the current screen theme. The `@media print` stylesheet overrides theme tokens (toner-friendly is non-negotiable).
- **Implementation strategy:** Tailwind `dark:` variants, driven by a `data-theme="dark"` attribute on `<html>`. We don't rely on `prefers-color-scheme` queries alone — the manual override has to be programmatic.

## Non-functional requirements

- Lighthouse performance > 90, accessibility > 95
- Total JS payload < 300 KB gzipped excluding audio samples
- Keyboard navigable: tab through root picker, then through scales
- Works offline after first load (stretch goal, not blocking v1)

## Out of scope (v1)

- Multi-octave score notation (the score is always one octave ascending; the piano keyboard is two octaves)
- Bass clef
- Different tempos / playback styles
- Sharing collections via URL
- Auth / cloud sync (will come with Supabase)
- Chord overlay on scales (lives in the chords spec)

## Open questions

All v1 open questions resolved during brainstorming on 2026-05-12. See git history for the resolution trace; the body of this spec reflects the decisions.

One item remains *provisional pending visual validation at implementation time*: **the root-key visual treatment** (color hierarchy vs marker). The current spec commits to color hierarchy as v1 baseline; if the rendered component doesn't make the root pop clearly enough, fall back to a marker (or layer one on top of the color).

## Superseded by the sticky-header design (2026-05-15)

A Claude Design handoff (`design_handoff_sticky_header/`) introduced a shared sticky-header pattern across both apps. It changes the scales page layout and accordion wiring:

- **Sticky header adopted.** The page now uses `StickyHeader` from `@jazzlore/ui` — a sticky translucent header that contains the page title, the inline root picker (desktop) / pill + bottom-sheet (mobile), and a scroll-spy chip row. One chip per scale family; the chip row is labelled "Scale categories".
- **Accordion state is now controlled (lifted).** `ScaleList` no longer owns `expanded` state internally. `ScalesPage` holds `expanded: Record<FamilyId, boolean>` and passes it down together with an `onExpandedChange` callback. `ScaleList` becomes a pure rendering component.
- **Chip-driven expand (expand-only).** Clicking a family chip in the sticky header expands that family's accordion section — but never collapses it. The expand-only guard lives in `ScalesPage.handleChipActivate`. The family's own accordion header button still toggles (expand and collapse) as before, via `onExpandedChange`.

Full rationale and the phased plan live in `.claude/plans/temporal-bouncing-bubble.md`; pixel spec in `design_handoff_sticky_header/README.md`.

## 2-column card grid on large desktops (2026-05-16)

Each expanded family's scale list is a responsive grid: 1 column by default, **2 columns at `xl` (≥1280px)** — a shared breakpoint with the chords app for cross-site consistency (see `apps/chords/docs/chords.md`). The family accordion header (`<h2>`) spans full width above its grid; an odd count leaves one trailing empty cell (`align-items: start` — not filled/centered/stretched, by design; revisit only on user feedback). The family-level scroll-spy anchor is the `<h2 id="group-…">` above the grid, so it is unaffected by the inner 2-col layout. Scale cards stack vertically (no side-by-side score|keyboard), so a half-width card naturally reads as a narrower full card — no internal-layout override is needed (unlike chords). Sub-breakpoint rendering (<1280) is byte-identical to the prior single-column layout (MD5-gated at 390/1024/1279). (History: first shipped at `2xl`/≥1536, moved to `xl`/≥1280 the same day per user request for two columns on regular desktops.)
